# Certificate Management

`kube-green` webhooks require a valid certificate to expose the webhook server to the Kubernetes API server.

## With cert-manager

By default, `kube-green` webhooks are designed to work with `cert-manager`.  
This is the recommended way to manage certificates for the webhook.

## Without cert-manager

If you want to avoid deploying `cert-manager`, you can use the following alternatives.

### Manual management of certificates

To manually manage the certificates, you need to create a K8s secret of type `kubernetes.io/tls` with `tls.crt` and `tls.key` keys.
The certificate in this secret must be signed by a CA and valid for the DNS name:

- SERVICE_NAME
- SERVICE_NAME.NAMESPACE
- SERVICE_NAME.NAMESPACE.svc
- SERVICE_NAME.NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local

where `SERVICE_NAME` is the name of the service which exposes the webhook (`kube-green-webhook-service` by default) and `NAMESPACE` is the namespace where the service is deployed.

Once created the secret, it must be mounted in the `kube-green` deployment as volume. If the secret is called `webhook-server-cert`, the volumes configuration should be the following:

```yaml
volumes:
- name: webhook-server-cert
  secret:
    secretName: <SECRET_NAME>
    optional: true
```

and the volume mount in the container:

```yaml
volumeMounts:
- name: webhook-server-cert
  mountPath: /tmp/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs
```

The CA which sign the certificate must be set as caBundle of clientConfig in the webhook configuration.

If you are using the `kustomize` configuration in the [kube-green repository](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green/tree/main/config), you can comment all the parts below the `[CERT-MANAGER]` comment and write a kustomization to insert the caBundle correctly.

Example of the webhook configuration to patch, with `<CA_BUNDLE>` as the base64 of the `ca.crt` file:

```yaml
webhooks:
  - name: vsleepinfo.kb.io
    clientConfig:
      caBundle: <CA_BUNDLE>
```

Each time the certificate will expire, you will need to update the secret with a new certificate.

<summary><i>Generate Self-Signed Certificates step by step</i></summary>

To generate self-signed certificates, it is possible to use the following commands (take this as an example):


Write a file with the following content with the openssl configuration (name it `openssl.conf`):

```bash
[ req ]
default_bits = 2048
prompt = no
default_md = sha256
req_extensions = req_ext
distinguished_name = dn

[ dn ]
CN = kube-green-webhook-service.kube-green.svc.cluster.local

[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = kube-green-webhook-service
DNS.2 = kube-green-webhook-service.kube-green
DNS.3 = kube-green-webhook-service.kube-green.svc
DNS.4 = kube-green-webhook-service.kube-green.svc.cluster.local
```

And then run the following commands:

```bash
# Generate CA private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca.key

# Generate CA certificate for 100 years
openssl req -new -nodes -x509 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -days 36500 -subj "/CN=The CA"

# Generate private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out tls.key

# Generate certificate signing request
openssl req -new -key tls.key -out tls.csr -config openssl.conf

# Generate certificate signed with the CA
openssl x509 -req -in tls.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out tls.crt -days 365 -extfile openssl.conf -extensions req_ext
```

After the creation of the certificates, you can create the secret with the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret tls webhook-server-cert --cert=./tls.crt --key=./tls.key
```

Once generated, you can create the `kube-green` manifests (commenting the `[CERT-MANAGER]` part), create the base64 of the `ca.crt` file and patch the webhook configuration with the new caBundle.

### Automated Management of Webhook Certificates

It is possible to manage the certificates using some tools which automate the process described above.

One tool that can be used is [kube-webhook-certgen](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/main/images/kube-webhook-certgen). It is possible to view a configuration of this tool in the [kube-green helm chart](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green/tree/main/charts). In this case, there are some jobs which create the certificate if it does not exist and patch the webhook manifest at runtime.

It is possible to enable it with setting the `jobsCert.enabled` to `true` in the `values.yaml` file of the chart and setting `certManager.enabled` to false.
