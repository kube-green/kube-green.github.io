# FAQ

### I have a couple of nodes with low utilization, but they are not scaled down. Why?

Have you set up the [cluster autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler)?

If the cluster autoscaler is set up, it should be correctly configured to scale down the nodes.
To see the possible issues, check the [cluster autoscaler documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#i-have-a-couple-of-nodes-with-low-utilization-but-they-are-not-scaled-down-why).

### I want to avoid deploying cert-manager. What are the alternatives?

You can find alternatives to cert-manager installation in the [cert-manager alternatives](/docs/advanced/webhook-cert-management#without-cert-manager) section.

### How much CO2 is produced by a pod?

These calculations are based on the following assumptions:

- Emissions for a cloud server using 100% green electricity: **160 Kg CO2eq / year and server** (from [goclimate.com](https://www.goclimate.com/blog/the-carbon-footprint-of-servers/#:~:text=Cloud%20server%20using%20100%%20green%20electricity:%20160%20kg%20CO2e%20/%20year%20and%20server)
)
- Cluster node of 2 CPUs. We approximate **1 node is 1 server**
- **15 pods per node**

With this assumption, the mean consumption of CO2 per pod in a year is 160 / 15 = **11 Kg CO2eq / year per pod**.

### What resources are supported?

*kube-green* adds default support to `Deployments`, `StatefulSets`, and `CronJobs`,
but it is possible to add support for other resources using the patches feature. More information is available
in the [configuration](configuration.md) section.
