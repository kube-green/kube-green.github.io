Everything is organized in categories and subcategories, so that it is easier to navigate and find the right tool for every need. The Landscape is maintained by the CNCF staff: everyone is encouraged to propose open-source projects by opening a pull request to the dedicated [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cncf/landscape).\\n\\n![CNCF landscape](/img/blog/cncf/cncf-landscape.png)\\n\\n## *kube-green* in the CNCF Landscape\\nStarting from October 7<sup>th</sup>, *kube-green* is listed in the Scheduling & Orchestration subcategory, which is part of the Orchestration & Management category.\\n\\n![Scheduling & Orchestration category](/img/blog/cncf/cncf-landscape-category.png)\\n\\nIn the same category of Kubernetes, the *de facto* standard for orchestrating containerized application, now you can find our open-source tool that allows you to schedule when to stop unused pods.\\n\\n![kube-green card](/img/blog/cncf/cncf-landscape-card.png)\\n\\nFor example, with *kube-green* you will be able to **stop all the pods of non-production environments at night-time and in non-working hours**. *kube-green* takes also care of **automatically restarting pods at scheduled hours**, and, if needed, you can always restart any pod at any time. In this way you can **save resources and money, while also reducing the carbon footprint** of your infrastructure. If you want to learn more about it, read our [Intro to *kube-green*](/blog/welcome-blog-post) and take a look at the [documentation](/docs/getting-started/).\\n\\n## Help us make kube-green grow\\n\\nWe strive to reach as many people as possible: the more people use *kube-green*, the more we reduce overall CO2 emissions. To do so, we need all the help we can get.\\n\\nHow can you contribute? There are many ways to make the difference, even for non-technical people. Here is a list of some actions you can take:\\n\\n- Tell everyone about *kube-green*: share the repository, the website, or the CNCF card on social media and tag us;\\n- Star the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green): let the world know how many people love this project;\\n- Join the community and connect with other users through the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green/discussions);\\n- Tell us how you use *kube-green* and what you love most of it: reach out to [Davide](https://github.com/davidebianchi) (creator of *kube-green*) or to [Michel](https://github.com/akelity) (Developer Advocate at [Mia-Platform](https://mia-platform.eu/)) and tell us everything;\\n- Improve the documentation by opening a pull request on the dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green.github.io);\\n- Expand the project, adding more features or resolving any [open issues](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green/issues): just follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)."},{"id":"kube-green-rebranding","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/kube-green-rebranding","editUrl":"https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green.github.io/edit/main/blog/blog/2022-10-07-new-logo-announcement.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-07-new-logo-announcement.mdx","title":"Announcing kube-green rebranding","description":"If you have been one of the early adopters of kube-green you may have noticed something different in these days.

New colors, new shapes, and a brand new logo? What it\'s all about? \\nYou may also be wondering if you are on the right repository, and if this is the same *kube-green* you are familiar with: don\'t worry, it is!\\n(Actually, a new version has been released: [take a look](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green/releases/tag/v0.4.1) at what\'s new on v0.4.1).\\n\\nWell, we are proud to announce that *kube-green* has gone through a full rebranding! Let\'s deep dive into it.\\n\\n## The reasons behind the rebranding\\n\\nTo date, *kube-green* is **effectively reducing CO2 emissions since almost two years**, and more and more projects are adopting *kube-green* to save energy and money. The repository has now more than 300 stars on GitHub, and it will soon be added to the [CNCF Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/).\\n\\nWe felt that *kube-green* reached the status of a **mature software project**, and it was the right moment to take a step further in giving it a full brand identity. We wanted the brand identity to match and reflect the maturity reached by the software, so that it will be easy to keep evolving.\\n\\nSo, working closely with [Fiorella Cerasuolo](https://github.com/Fiore17), Brand Designer at [Mia-Platform](https://mia-platform.eu/), we defined all the visual assets that define the new brand identity of *kube-green*.\\n\\n## The new logo\\n\\nThe greatest rebranding makeover involved the logo, that has been redesigned almost from scratch. However, it was not a disruptive revolution, but a well-reasoned evolution.\\n\\n![kube-green logo concept](/img/blog/new-logo/kube-green-logo-concept.png)\\n\\nAs the name suggests, *kube-green* works with Kubernetes. In particular, it is a Kubernetes operator that shuts down all the pods in non-production environments during non business hours. So, the logo of *kube-green* needs to evoke Kubernetes.\\nThe previous logo recalled Kubernetes one with the seven-branched nautical helm, but for the new logo we wanted something more defined and less evident. For this reason we opted for **a heptagon for the external shape**: the seven sides of the polygon are a clear reference to the seven branches of Kubernetes\' helm.\\n\\n![kube-green new shape](/img/blog/new-logo/kube-green-logo-helm.png)\\n\\nOn the background of the polygon there are **two waves, representing the sea**. This is another reference to the nautical theme derived from Kubernetes, together with the heptagon.\\nBut it is also a first allusion to the main feature of *kube-green*, which is reducing CO2 pollution. In fact, the waves stand for the purity of how the open sea should be: unpolluted and uncontaminated.\\n\\nAt the center of the polygon there is **a big green leaf**, that is the worldwide recognized symbol of all the green initiatives. The leaf was the heart also of the previous logo, and we kept it also at the very center of the new logo to clearly state the main purpose of *kube-green*: helping the environment by reducing the CO2 footprint of Kubernetes clusters.\\nThe shape of the leaf has been slightly compared with the original, to better match the new overall look and feel of the logo.\\n\\n![kube-green leaf](/img/blog/new-logo/kube-green-logo-leaf.png)\\n\\n## The new colors\\n\\nThe rebranding involved also the colors of *kube-green*. The **green remained the main chromatic key**, but we revised the adopted shades to make them more recognizable.\\n\\nWe opted for bright colors for two main reasons: we wanted *kube-green* to be recognized as a high-technological product, and we wanted it to stand out in the CNCF Landscape.\\nHowever, in choosing the colors, particular attention has been paid to the **readability and accessibility of the logo**. We made sure that the logo passed all the contrast tests, so that everyone can see it clearly.\\n\\nThe color palette includes three main shades: dark green, light green, and grey.\\nThe dark green contains a little tone of blue. It is barely perceptible, but it reminds to the nautical theme of Kubernetes.\\nThe light green is very bright: its main purpose is to give the idea of an **innovative software**, that leverages the latest available technologies.\\nThe grey scale goes from the white, that acts as a definition mark between the elements of the logo, to a dark grey tending to green.\\n\\n![kube-green color palette](/img/blog/new-logo/kube-green-palette.png)\\n\\nThe external heptagon is colored with a seamless transition from the light green to the dark green. The gradient gives light and motion to the entire logo. \\nAlso, the two different colors make the logo easily readable on both white and black backgrounds: this is a very important property for a software. In fact, [*kube-green*\'s repository](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green) is hosted on GitHub, that allows users to choose between a dark and a light mode, and so does the [official website](https://kube-green.dev/).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAs you can see, there was a great effort behind this rebranding: we strive to do everything we can to make *kube-green* work better, and we believe that its success will depend also from its recognizability.\\n\\nWe believe that **a great software needs a strong identity**, and we did our best to give *kube-green* a long-lasting brand identity."},{"id":"welcome-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green.github.io/edit/main/blog/blog/2022-01-05-first-blog-post.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-05-first-blog-post.mdx","title":"Intro to kube-green","description":"Welcome to kube-green blog!","date":"2022-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 5, 2022","tags":[{"label":"kube-green","permalink":"/blog/tags/kube-green"},{"label":"introduction","permalink":"/blog/tags/introduction"}],"readingTime":2.175,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Bianchi","title":"Creator of kube-green","url":"https://github.com/davidebianchi","imageURL":"https://github.com/davidebianchi.png","key":"davidebianchi"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome-blog-post","title":"Intro to kube-green","authors":["davidebianchi"],"tags":["kube-green","introduction"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Announcing kube-green rebranding","permalink":"/blog/kube-green-rebranding"}},"content":"Welcome to *kube-green* blog!\\n\\nIn this blog, we\'ll introduce the new features of *kube-green*, and give you some other information about *kube-green*.\\n\\nIn this first tutorial, I will try to explain how it was born and why it is useful for reducing waste of resources.\\n\\n## Environmental impact\\n\\nEverything we do online has an impact on the real world environment.  \\nFrom the emails in our inboxes to photos and videos on the cloud, from online games to digital currency, all this digital activity run on physical servers that constantly use energy.\\n\\nJust some examples:\\n\\n- minecraft all time emissions are about 600 million Kg of CO2, equivalent to drive at about 2,1 billion of km ([reference](https://www.saveonenergy.com/uk/environmental-impact-of-video-games/))\\n- bitcoin produces between 22 and 22.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, or between the levels produced by Jordan and Sri Lanka ([reference](https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-big-is-bitcoins-carbon-footprint-2021-05-13/))\\n- [here](https://thanks-in-advance.com/) it is possible to see how much emissions our emails generate\\n\\nThe Kubernetes clusters are not an exception. Also if they run in a cloud provider far from us they produces CO2, also if not used.\\n\\n## The idea of kube-green\\n\\nIn a cluster, non production namespaces are usually used only during business hours.  \\nThe business hours are around 40 hours per week, respect the total number of weekly hours which are 168.  \\nAlso, in Kubernetes the resources could be allocated (both CPU and memory, setting the request of a container) also if not used. This means most of the time the pods in these namespaces are unnecessarily consuming resources.\\n\\nThe basic idea of *kube-green* is to stop all pods in those namespaces.  \\n\\n![kube-green idea](/img/blog/first-blog-post/idea.png)\\n\\n### How it is possible?\\n\\n*kube-green* is a Kubernetes controller, which define a Custom Resource Definition called *SleepInfo*. *SleepInfo* CRD define when stop and restart the pods in a namespace.\\n\\nSo, for example in development namespaces, it is possible to stop all the pods in non business hours: wake up every morning from monday to friday and stop every night from monday to friday.\\n\\nAn example of *SleepInfo* CRD to make it is:\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: kube-green.com/v1alpha1\\nkind: SleepInfo\\nmetadata:\\n  name: working-hours\\nspec:\\n  weekdays: \\"1-5\\"\\n  sleepAt: \\"20:00\\"\\n  wakeUpAt: \\"08:00\\"\\n  timeZone: \\"Europe/Rome\\"\\n  suspendCronJobs: true\\n```\\n\\n## What resources can you suspend?\\n\\nAt the time of this post, with *kube-green* at [v0.2.0](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green/tree/v0.2.0), it is possible to sleep only **Deployment**.\\nOther resources will be added in the future.  \\nIf you need some particular resources, write it in [this issue](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green/issues/77) to set it in roadmap!\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nDo you want to reduce the CO2 emissions and costs of your Kubernetes cluster?\\n\\n[Read our documentation](/docs/getting-started) to install **kube-green** in your cluster!"}]}')}}]);
