# Getting Started

## Overview

How many of your dev/preview pods stay on during weekends? Or at night? It's a waste of resources! And money! But fear not, *kube-green* is here to the rescue.

*kube-green* is a simple k8s addon that automatically shuts down (some of) your resources when you don't need them.

How much CO2 does a pod produce yearly?  
By our assumption, it's about 11 Kg CO2eq per year per pod ([here](./FAQ.mdx#how-many-co2-is-produced-by-pod) is the calculation).

Use this tool to calculate it:

import ConsumptionCalculator from '../src/components/ConsumptionCalculator'

<ConsumptionCalculator />
<br></br>

Keep reading to find out how to use it, and if you have ideas on how to improve *kube-green*, [open an issue](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green/issues/new) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green/discussions/new), we'd love to hear them!

## Tutorials

Try our tutorials to get started. They are available [here](tutorials/kind.md).

## Install

To start using kube-green, you need to install it in a Kubernetes cluster.
[Click here](./installation/index.md) to see how to install.

## Create and deploy SleepInfo

You can take a look at example configurations [available here](https://github.com/kube-green/kube-green/tree/main/testdata), or create it with the docs [here](configuration.md).

And that's it! Now, let *kube-green* sleep your pods and save CO2!
